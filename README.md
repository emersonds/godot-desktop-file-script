# Script to Install Godot and Make Desktop File
This is a helper script that installs the given version of Godot from the official archive and creates a desktop file for it in `~/.local/share/applications/`.
# Requirements
Linux: Ubuntu or Debian. Arch support hopefully coming soon.
# Installation
1. `git clone` this repository (this is highly recommended to ensure the icon is created successfully).
2. Run the script.
3. Input the desired version of Godot (4.3-stable, 4.4-stable, 4.4.1-stable, etc.).
4. Verify the installation by checking your Applications Menu (may require reboot).
# Updating Or Changing Version
Because Godot keeps an archive of all of their releases, simply run the installation script again.
