# Script to Install Godot and Make Desktop File
This is a helper script that installs the given version of Godot from the official archive and creates a desktop file for it in `~/.local/share/applications/`.
# Requirements
Tested on Linux Distributions:
- Arch Linux (CachyOS)
- Ubuntu/Debian (Linux Mint)
# Installation
1. `git clone` this repository (this is highly recommended to ensure the icon is created successfully).
2. Run the script using `bash installer-script.sh`.
3. Input the desired stable version of Godot (4.3, 4.4, 4.4.1, etc.).
4. Verify the installation by checking your Applications Menu (may require reboot).
# Updating Or Changing Version
Because Godot keeps an archive of all of their releases, simply run the installation script again.
# Important Notice
This script only installs STABLE versions of Godot. The script may be modified if preview versions are desired.
